# learn-devops
This repository is to document my devops journey. I am attempting to keep track of useful links and tidbits and to learn devops with small tasks. Each task should have an associated objective covering a devops related concept inclusing Containers, Container Orchestration, Infrastructure As Code, Version Control etc

Very much a WIP
